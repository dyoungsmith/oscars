Goal: 
    - print 'Year Title Budget' for each year's winner
    - print out the average budget for all winners
        - sum of all budgets
        - number of films


Structure of http://oscars.yipitdata.com/
    - results array contains objects for each year's nominees ('films' array)
    - relevant info for each film:
        - 'Detail URL' (follow this for budget) // going to have problems with this space
            - { Budget: "US$ 2 million [ 4 ]" } // will have to get this to numbers for maths
        - 'Film' (the title)
        - 'Winner' (bool)   // first one looks like the winner always (yay)
    - relevant info for each year
        - 'year' (this is a string: '1927 / 28 [A] (1st)')
        - the parentheses denote which movie it is (although, not sure if this is trustworthy)
            - could potentially use for avg, but I'd rather trust my own work, ha

    results: [
        { 
            year: '1927 / 28 [A] (1st)',
            films: [
                {
                    Detail URL: 'http:...',
                    Film: 'Title',
                    Winner: true
                },
                { ... }
            ]
        },
        { ... }
    ]
